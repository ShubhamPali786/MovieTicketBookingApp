His acts of valour and bravery continued to inspire soldiers long after he lost his life in battle.Endowed with a body of steel, the courage of a lion and an agile mind, Tanhaji was also one of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj`s closest aides and trusted lieutenants. Ready to lay down his life for his King and country, this braveheart planned a surgical strike to get back the Kondana Fort against the Mughal army headed by Udaybhan.When the fort of Kondana, that was the pride of the Marathas was under the control of Udaybhan and a Mughal army, Tanhaji went to war armed only with a handful of Marathas. If the Mughals had muscle power, Tanhaji had sharp acumen. The only unfortunate thing is--the Marathas won Kondana but they lost their Lion. Tanhaji left behind a void that none in history could ever fill.Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is a visual extravaganza that depicts the life and times of this unsung warrior, whose valour still makes the Nation proud."

      "synopsis": "Tanhaji Malusare was an unsung warrior from the 17th century. His acts of valour and bravery continued to inspire soldiers long after he lost his life in battle.Endowed with a body of steel, the courage of a lion and an agile mind, Tanhaji was also one of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj`s closest aides and trusted lieutenants. Ready to lay down his life for his King and country, this braveheart planned a surgical strike to get back the Kondana Fort against the Mughal army headed by Udaybhan.When the fort of Kondana, that was the pride of the Marathas was under the control of Udaybhan and a Mughal army, Tanhaji went to war armed only with a handful of Marathas. If the Mughals had muscle power, Tanhaji had sharp acumen. The only unfortunate thing is--the Marathas won Kondana but they lost their Lion. Tanhaji left behind a void that none in history could ever fill.Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is a visual extravaganza that depicts the life and times of this unsung warrior, whose valour still makes the Nation proud."
